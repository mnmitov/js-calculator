JS Calculator

It's a simple calculator developed in my spare time with my knowledge in JavaScript, CSS, HTML and BootStrap.
I'm a backend developer, so the design may not look so professional.

So far, this app makes only simple calculations like adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. Soon I will add more.
I developed a history function for calculating.

This app will be enhanced with something interesting soon.
